`pcf8523` - PCF8523 Real Time Clock module
==========================================

This library supports the use of the PCF8523-based RTC in CircuitPython. It
contains a base RTC class used by all Adafruit RTC libraries. This base
class is inherited by the chip-specific subclasses.

Functions are included for reading and writing registers and manipulating
datetime objects.

Author(s): Philip R. Moyer and Radomir Dopieralski for Adafruit Industries.
Date: November 2016
Affiliation: Adafruit Industries

Implementation Notes
--------------------

**Hardware:**

* Adafruit `Adalogger FeatherWing - RTC + SD Add-on <https://www.adafruit.com/products/2922>`_
  (Product ID: 2922)
* Adafruit `PCF8523 RTC breakout <https://www.adafruit.com/products/3295>`_ (Product ID: 3295)

**Software and Dependencies:**

* Adafruit CircuitPython firmware for the supported boards:
  https://circuitpython.org/downloads

* Adafruit's Register library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Register

* Adafruit's Bus Device library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice

**Notes:**

#. Milliseconds are not supported by this RTC.
#. The alarm does not support seconds. It will always fire on full minutes.

    **Quickstart: Importing and using the device**

        Here is an example of using the :class:`PCF8523` class.
        First you will need to import the libraries to use the sensor

        .. code-block:: python

            import time
            import board
            import adafruit_pcf8523

        Once this is done you can define your `board.I2C` object and define your sensor object

        .. code-block:: python

            i2c = board.I2C()  # uses board.SCL and board.SDA
            rtc = adafruit_pcf8523.PCF8523(i2c)

        Now you can give the current time to the device.

        .. code-block:: python

            t = time.struct_time((2017, 10, 29, 15, 14, 15, 0, -1, -1))
            rtc.datetime = t

        You can access the current time accessing the :attr:`datetime` attribute.

        .. code-block:: python

            current_time = rtc.datetime
